Subject: Partnership Opportunity with BUSL

Hi {{company}},

I hope this finds you well.
 
On behalf of the British University Swimming League, I would like to invite Right Move to join our mission of making swimming an exciting and inclusive sport to be a part of.

Traditionally, swimming is an expensive and selective sport with a low retention rate in young adults, the BUSL is breaking those standards. Now going into our fourth year, we are continuing to grow. Last season, we had 63 universities participating and over 3500+ student swimmers from across the UK involved with bigger and better things to come!
Take a look at what we are doing with our event video here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oh0qSb8GlY

Having looked into {{company}} we feel the BUSL aligns well with your target audience, and is a fantastic way to gain brand recognition among our student-athletes, universities, and coaches as well as our swimmer's friends and families.

Let me know when you would be free to call so we can discuss this opportunity
 
We look forward to hearing from you!
 
All the best,
Luke Horner-Long
