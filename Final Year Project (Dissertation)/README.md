# Final Year Project â€“ ATMOS 

ATMOS is a tool aimed at applying agile methodologies to neurodiverse individuals with the hope to help users overcome their struggles with executive functions and ultimatley improve their daily task managment.

This folder contains information about my final year project developed as part of my university degree. Due to university policy, I am unable to make the project repository public until final assessment and grading have been completed.

## ðŸ”’ Repository Access

As per academic regulations, I am not permitted to publish this project publicly until I have received my final mark. However, I would be happy to provide **private access** to those interested. Please feel free to reach out, and I can share the private GitHub repository with you directly.
